# Overview

This project was for me to figure out how to set up, use, and manipulate a database with python! I wrote a program that connects to a Firebase Cloud Database. I then use the firebase_admin module to be able to connect with, write to, and read from this database. 

My purpose for writing this software was so that I could be able to learn how to use Cloud Databases and connect them with my own software.

# Cloud Database

I am using Firebase from Google Firestore as my cloud Database.

My database has two tables, one for canivorous dinosaurs and one for herbivore dinosaurs. Inside those tables are the names of the dinosaurs and those tables hold the length in feet and the weight in tons of each dinosaur.

# Development Environment

I am using Visual Studio Code and Firebase. 

I am using python 3.10 and I downloaded a module called firebase_admin that allows me to connect to the database in my program.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I plan to add more facts to each of the dinosaurs such as time period and perhaps including a picture for each one.
* I need to fix the program so that it has more error catching and stuff like that.
* The last thing is that I want to add user authentication to it so that you can login and save your favorite dinosaurs.
